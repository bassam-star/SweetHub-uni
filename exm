Critical Success Tips:
During Study Sessions:
	1.	Phone OFF or in another room - no distractions!
	2.	Drink water - keep a bottle with you
	3.	Take breaks seriously - walk, stretch, pray
	4.	Don’t just read - actively DO (write, draw, solve)
	5.	Practice with TIME LIMITS - simulate exam conditions
For Each Subject:
	•	Always START with active recall (what do I remember?)
	•	Then CHECK your notes (what did I miss?)
	•	Then PRACTICE (solve problems/write answers)
	•	Then REVIEW again the next day (spaced repetition!)
Avoid These Study Mistakes:
	•	❌ Just reading notes over and over
	•	❌ Highlighting everything
	•	❌ Studying with your phone nearby
	•	❌ Cramming one subject for hours without breaks
	•	❌ Not testing yourself
Energy Management:
	•	Best focus hours: Right after Fajr (5:30-9:00 AM) - tackle hardest subjects!
	•	Mid-morning: Good for practice problems (9:00-11:30 AM)
	•	Before lunch: Review and consolidation (11:30 AM-1:30 PM)
Evening Chill Time Ideas (1:30-9:30 PM):
	•	Light review while having tea (30 mins max!)
	•	Exercise - helps memory!
	•	Social time with family/friends
	•	Watch educational videos (fun learning)
	•	But mostly: REST and recharge!
Emergency: If You Fall Behind
If a day doesn’t go as planned:
	1.	Don’t panic - adjust, don’t abandon!
	2.	Prioritize: Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology (usually most challenging)
	3.	Skip the “chill” review sessions and focus on weak subjects
	4.	Use Day 6 to catch up if needed
Night Before Exams:
	•	Light review ONLY
	•	No new material
	•	Get 8 hours sleep (9:30 PM - 5:30 AM)
	•	Make du’a and trust your preparation
Remember: You have 6 solid days. If you follow this plan with discipline, you’ll cover all 20 exams effectively. Trust the process, stay consistent, and make du’a. You got this! 💪
Bismillah - Start strong, finish strong!
